Dependencies for RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m MATLAB Script:

Required Files: The scripts are self-contained and rely exclusively on MATLAB's built-in functions, requiring no external dependencies. They are also compatible with earlier versions of MATLAB. Sample images from the datasets cited in the manuscript can be used to execute the code.

Required Matlab Toolboxes for RCAD_SVD.m:

Toolbox: Image Processing Toolbox
Version: 11.4
Product Number: 49

Required Matlab Toolboxes for RCAD_PCA.m:
Toolbox: Signal Processing Toolbox
Version: 8.0
Product Number: 3

Workflow for Implementing RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m:

MATLAB Workflow:
Input Image → R-CAD Method → Wavelet Transform → Quantization (PCA/SVD) → Inverse Transform → Reconstruction → Evaluation (PSNR/SSIM/MSE)

Step 1: Environment Setup:
a)  Ensure MATLAB is installed (any earlier version compatible with the scripts)
    Verify the required MATLAB Toolboxes:
    Image Processing Toolbox (Version 11.4, Product Number 49)
    Signal Processing Toolbox (Version 8.0, Product Number 3)
b)  Place the RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m files in your MATLAB working directory

Step 2: Input Data Preparation:
a)  Use sample images from the dataset referenced in the manuscript
b)  Place the images in the MATLAB working directory or provide the full path to the script
c)  Ensure the images are in standard formats such as .jpg or .png

Step 3: Execute the Code:
a)  Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m
b)  Use the Command Window or Editor.
c)  For SVD-based Entropy Minimization:
    Run the following script:
    RCAD_SVD.m
    For PCA-based Entropy Minimization:
    Run the following script:
    RCAD_PCA.m
d)  Output of Each Script:
    i)  Residual Image Computation
    ii)  Wavelet Transformation into LL, HL, LH, HH bands
    iii) Quantization using SVD (RCAD_SVD.m) or PCA (RCAD_PCA.m)
    iv)  Image Reconstruction using Inverse Wavelet and R-CAD methods
    v)  Evaluation Metrics: PSNR, SSIM, MSE are displayed as output

Step 4: Review the Results:
a)  The reconstructed images and evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, and MSE) will be displayed on the screen
b)  Save the output images for comparison
