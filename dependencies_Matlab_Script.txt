Dependencies for RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m MATLAB Script:

Required Files: The scripts are self-contained and rely exclusively on MATLAB's built-in functions, requiring no external dependencies. They are also compatible with earlier versions of MATLAB. Sample images from the datasets cited in the manuscript can be used to execute the code.

Required Matlab Toolboxes for RCAD_SVD.m:

Toolbox: Image Processing Toolbox
Version: 11.4
Product Number: 49

Required Matlab Toolboxes for RCAD_PCA.m:
Toolbox: Signal Processing Toolbox
Version: 8.0
Product Number: 3


Methodology 1: Entropy Minimization with PCA and SVD

Steps in Workflow of RCAD_SVD.m and RCAD_PCA.m:  

i)  The process starts with reading the input image.

ii) R-CAD Method: Row-wise and column-wise differences are computed by implementing the R-CAD algorithm to generate residual images.

iii) Wavelet Transformation: Haar Wavelet Transform is applied to the residual image to decompose it into sub-bands (e.g., LL, HL, LH, HH).

iv)  Quantization with PCA and SVD: The script RCAD_SVD.m applies quantization to HH band by applying the SVD method. The script RCAD_PCA.m applies PCA to HH band for effective quantization. 

v)  Inverse Transformation: The quantized residual image undergoes an inverse wavelet transform and inverse iR-CAD method to reconstruct the original image.

vi)  Evaluation benchmarks (PSNR/SSIM/MSE):   a)PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures quality.
                                              b)SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Measures structural similarity.
