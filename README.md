# Image-Compression
Entropy-Minimized Residual Image Compression with Y-Net Augmented Autoencoder Architecture and Data-Driven Transforms
Utilizes PCA and SVD along with wavelet transforms for residual image compression. Also implements Y-network for efficient feature extraction augmented by an autoencoder for compressed data transmission and reconstruction.
